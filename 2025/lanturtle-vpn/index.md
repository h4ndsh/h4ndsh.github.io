# DIY LAN Turtle - Building a Stealth Remote Access Device

In this post, I share my experience building a DIY stealth remote access device using the Luckfox Pico Max RV1106. Inspired by the commercial LAN Turtle but seeking a more affordable solution, I created this device to enable remote network access without complex port forwarding or traditional VPN setups. This project served as both a practical solution and a valuable learning experience in hardware integration and network security.

<p style="font-weight: bold; color: #B85952">
This project uses free third-party services! And as the saying goes: <i>if it's free, you are the product!</i>
This is just an example of usage. My goal is not to connect to locations that could compromise sensitive information or infrastructure.

# Idea

My goal was simple: I wanted reliable remote access to local networks without the hassle of complex VPN setups or router configuration. Since I often don‚Äôt have access to the router, I needed a true plug-and-play solution. While the commercial LAN Turtle provides these capabilities, its high price pushed me to explore a more cost-effective alternative. This project became an opportunity not just to build my own solution, but also to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies.

# ÔøΩ Smecurity & Legal Considerations

**Important:** This device should only be used on networks you own or have explicit permission to access. Unauthorized network access is illegal in most jurisdictions.

**Security Best Practices:**
- Change default passwords immediately after setup
- Enable SSH key authentication and disable password login
- Regularly update the system: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
- Monitor device access logs: `sudo journalctl -f`
- Use strong API tokens and rotate them regularly
- Consider using a dedicated VLAN for the device

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Third-party VPN services can potentially log your traffic
- Consider self-hosted alternatives like WireGuard for sensitive environments
- Review the privacy policy of your chosen VPN provider

# üöÄ Implementation Luckfox Pico

I performed all testing on Linux. Here's how I put everything together:

## Setting Up the SDK

First, I prepared my development environment:

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt-get install -y git ssh make gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib module-assistant expect g++ gawk texinfo libssl-dev bison flex fakeroot cmake unzip gperf autoconf device-tree-compiler libncurses5-dev pkg-config bc python-is-python3 passwd openssl openssh-server openssh-client vim file cpio rsync
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuckfoxTECH/luckfox-pico.git
cd luckfox-pico
./build.sh lunch
```

In the lunch script, I selected:
- RV1106 board [6]
- SD Card boot [0]
- Ubuntu OS [1]

## Building the Operating System

After several attempts, I discovered that the third-party VPN required the UTS namespace to be enabled in the kernel. Here‚Äôs how I activated it:

```bash
./build.sh kernelconfig
```

I navigated to:
```bash
-> General setup
-> Namespaces support (NAMESPACES [=Y])  
[*] UTS namespace (NEW) 
```

After saving the configuration and building the kernel, the output files were stored in `luckfox-pico/output/image/`.

## Luckfox Pico OS Installation 

For installation, I used a Windows VM and the `SocToolKit` software from the SDK (`luckfox-pico/tools/windows/SocToolKit`). The process was straightforward - just selecting the compiled image files and target microSD card. The [official documentation](https://wiki.luckfox.com/Luckfox-Pico/Luckfox-Pico-quick-start/SD-Card-burn-image) provides detailed instructions if needed.

## Network Configuration

After the OS installation, I needed to configure the eth0 interface for DHCP. This ensures the device automatically gets an IP address when connected to a network:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0
```

Add the following configuration:

```
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

To apply the changes without rebooting:

```bash
sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0
```

Alternatively, restart the networking service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

Finally, reboot the device to ensure all configurations are properly loaded:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Verify the configuration is working:

```bash
ip addr show eth0
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```


## VPN Setup

![Twingate](./Twingate_Logo.jpeg "Twingate")


For remote access, I chose [Twingate](https://www.twingate.com) for its excellent free tier, which perfectly suited my needs. Since I had never used it before, I decided to try it for this project. Alternatives like [OpenZiti](https://openziti.io/) and [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) also offer great solutions, but Twingate stood out for its simplicity and ease of setup.


1. Created a Twingate account
2. Created a new Network [(Network > Remote Networks > + Remote Network - select "other")](https://<name>.twingate.com/networks?sortBy=name)
3. Added a Connector (Network > "network name" > + Add Connector)
4. Installed the Connector on my Luckfox Pico ("Inside Connector" > Linux > Generate Tokens > Copy Command)
5. SSH'd into the Luckfox Pico and run:

```bash
curl "https://binaries.twingate.com/connector/setup.sh" | sudo TWINGATE_ACCESS_TOKEN="" TWINGATE_REFRESH_TOKEN="" TWINGATE_NETWORK="<name>" TWINGATE_LABEL_DEPLOYED_BY="linux" bash
```

## Twingate Client Setup (Optional)

If you want to use the device as a client as well, install the Twingate client:

```bash
# Install client
curl -s https://binaries.twingate.com/client/linux/install.sh | sudo bash

# Configure
twingate setup

# Start service
twingate start
```

## Resources Configuration

I added resources through the Twingate dashboard [(Network > Resources > + Resource)](https://<name>.twingate.com/resources?sortBy=name)

## Automatically Adding Resources

To make the device truly plug-and-play, I created a Python script that automatically discovers and adds network resources via the Twingate API. This eliminates the need to manually configure resources for each new network.

**1. Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install gql requests
```

**2. Settings > API > Generate Token**  
**3. Replace the variables in the script accordingly.** 

```python
import json
import os
import socket
import time
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

# Twingate API settings
API_URL = "https://<name>.twingate.com/api/graphql/"
API_KEY = "api-token"
TARGET_NETWORK_NAME = "<network-name>"

# Path for the resources tracking file
RESOURCES_FILE = "/home/pico/scripts/resources.json"

# Function to check internet connectivity
def check_internet_connection(host="8.8.8.8", port=53, timeout=3):
    """
    Check if there is an internet connection by trying to connect to Google's DNS server.
    Returns True if connection is available, False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        socket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout)
        socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM).connect((host, port))
        return True
    except socket.error:
        return False

# Rest of your existing code remains the same

```

**3. Running at Startup**

To run the script at startup, I added the following entry to crontab:

```bash
@reboot /usr/bin/python3 /home/pico/scripts/twingate-updater.py >> /home/pico/scripts/twingate-updater.log 2>&1
```

If necessary, adjust the file and log paths accordingly.

**4. Testing**

To verify that everything is working correctly, I simply restart the device and check if new resources have been created in Twingate. I then log in to the Twingate website to confirm the new resources.

In my case, three new resources were created:

- LAN network IP (connected to the AP): 172.16.0.91
- USB connection IP: 172.32.0.70
- Public IP: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx


**5. Resource Permissions**

With these resources added, I can grant access to either everyone or specific groups. In my case, I assigned the resource to "Everybody."

To verify permissions, I use the Twingate CLI on my host machine:

```bash
twingate resources
```

**6. TCP and UDP Port Permissions**

It is also possible to allow or restrict specific ports for each resource. By default, all ports are open (*).

**7. Testing the Connection**

Once outside the network, I can test the connection by running:

```bash
twingate start
ssh pico@172.16.0.91
```

This establishes a remote connection to the device.

# Testing the Setup

I started by adding SSH access to my Luckfox Pico as a resource. Then, I scanned my network for potential targets:

```bash
nmap -sn -Sv 172.16.0.0/24
```

Once I identified available ports, I manually added specific resources to Twingate. For example, if I found a device at 172.16.0.80 with port 80 open, I could add it as a resource. After that, I could access the device through my browser as if I were inside the network.

# Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues I encountered and their solutions:

## Network Interface Issues

**Problem:** eth0 interface not coming up automatically
```bash
# Check interface status
ip link show eth0

# Manually bring up interface
sudo ip link set eth0 up
sudo dhclient eth0
```

**Problem:** DHCP not working
```bash
# Check DHCP client logs
sudo journalctl -u dhcpcd
# or
sudo journalctl -u systemd-networkd
```

## Twingate Connection Issues

**Problem:** Connector not connecting
```bash
# Check connector status
sudo systemctl status twingate-connector

# Restart connector
sudo systemctl restart twingate-connector

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u twingate-connector -f
```

**Problem:** Resources not accessible
- Verify resource permissions in Twingate dashboard
- Check if ports are correctly configured
- Test connectivity: `telnet <resource-ip> <port>`

## Python Script Issues

**Problem:** API script failing
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip3 install gql requests

# Check script permissions
chmod +x /home/pico/scripts/twingate-updater.py

# Test script manually
python3 /home/pico/scripts/twingate-updater.py
```

# 3D Printed Case

To protect my device and make it more portable, I looked into printing a case. Here are the models I found most useful:

- [Thingiverse Model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6670447)
- [Printables Model](https://www.printables.com/model/945919-luckfox-pico-promax-rv1106-case-pico-plusmini-rv11?lang=en)

# Performance & Limitations

**Network Performance:**
- Ethernet: 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet)
- Typical throughput: 80-90Mbps
- Latency: +20-50ms (depending on VPN service)

**Power Consumption:**
- Idle: ~1.5W
- Active: ~2.5W
- Can run on power banks for 8-12 hours

**Limitations:**
- No PoE support (requires separate power)
- 100Mbps max speed (no Gigabit)
- Limited to 256MB RAM
- Depends on third-party VPN service reliability

# How to Use?
**It's super simple! I just plug the hardware into the Ethernet port, power it with a power bank, a DC adapter, or whatever nearby USB port happens to offer 5V and voil√†!**
