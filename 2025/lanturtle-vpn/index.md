# DIY LAN Turtle - Building a Stealth Remote Access Device

In this post, I share my experience building a DIY stealth remote access device using the Luckfox Pico Max RV1106. Inspired by the commercial LAN Turtle but seeking a more affordable solution, I created this device to enable remote network access without complex port forwarding or traditional VPN setups. This project served as both a practical solution and a valuable learning experience in hardware integration and network security.

This project uses free third-party services! And as the saying goes: <i>if it's free, you are the product!</i>
This is just an example of usage. My goal is not to connect to locations that could compromise sensitive information or infrastructure.

# Idea

My goal was simple: I wanted reliable remote access to local networks without the hassle of complex VPN setups or router configuration. Since I often don‚Äôt have access to the router, I needed a true plug-and-play solution. While the commercial LAN Turtle provides these capabilities, its high price pushed me to explore a more cost-effective alternative. This project became an opportunity not just to build my own solution, but also to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies.

# Hardware Selection


After researching various options, I chose the [Luckfox Pico Max RV1106](https://www.luckfox.com/EN-Luckfox-Pico-Max) as the core of my project. This compact device offers an impressive set of features at a remarkably affordable price point.

# üöÄ Implementation Luckfox Pico

I performed all testing on Linux. Here's how I put everything together:

## Setting Up the SDK

First, I prepared my development environment:

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt-get install -y git ssh make gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib module-assistant expect g++ gawk texinfo libssl-dev bison flex fakeroot cmake unzip gperf autoconf device-tree-compiler libncurses5-dev pkg-config bc python-is-python3 passwd openssl openssh-server openssh-client vim file cpio rsync
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuckfoxTECH/luckfox-pico.git
cd luckfox-pico
./build.sh lunch
```

In the lunch script, I selected:
- RV1106 board [6]
- SD Card boot [0]
- Ubuntu OS [1]

## Building the Operating System

After several attempts, I discovered that the third-party VPN required the UTS namespace to be enabled in the kernel. Here‚Äôs how I activated it:

```bash
./build.sh kernelconfig
```

I navigated to:
```bash
-> General setup
-> Namespaces support (NAMESPACES [=Y])  
[*] UTS namespace (NEW) 
```

After saving the configuration and building the kernel, the output files were stored in `luckfox-pico/output/image/`.

## Luckfox Pico OS Installation 

For installation, I used a Windows VM and the `SocToolKit` software from the SDK (`luckfox-pico/tools/windows/SocToolKit`). The process was straightforward - just selecting the compiled image files and target microSD card. The [official documentation](https://wiki.luckfox.com/Luckfox-Pico/Luckfox-Pico-quick-start/SD-Card-burn-image) provides detailed instructions if needed.


## VPN Setup

![Twingate](./Twingate_Logo.jpeg "Twingate")


For remote access, I chose [Twingate](https://www.twingate.com) for its excellent free tier, which perfectly suited my needs. Since I had never used it before, I decided to try it for this project. Alternatives like [OpenZiti](https://openziti.io/) and [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) also offer great solutions, but Twingate stood out for its simplicity and ease of setup.


1. Created a Twingate account
2. Created a new Network [(Network > Remote Networks > + Remote Network - select "other")](https://<name>.twingate.com/networks?sortBy=name)
3. Added a Connector (Network > "network name" > + Add Connector)
4. Installed the Connector on my Luckfox Pico ("Inside Connector" > Linux > Generate Tokens > Copy Command)
5. SSH'd into the Luckfox Pico and run:

```bash
curl "https://binaries.twingate.com/connector/setup.sh" | sudo TWINGATE_ACCESS_TOKEN="" TWINGATE_REFRESH_TOKEN="" TWINGATE_NETWORK="<name>" TWINGATE_LABEL_DEPLOYED_BY="linux" bash
```

## Twingate Client Setup

> Installed the client:
> ```bash
> curl -s https://binaries.twingate.com/client/linux/install.sh | sudo bash
> ```

> Configured:
> ```bash
> twingate setup
> ```

> Started the service:
> ```bash
> twingate start
> ```

## Resources Configuration

I added resources through the Twingate dashboard [(Network > Resources > + Resource)](https://<name>.twingate.com/resources?sortBy=name)

## Automatically Adding Resources

Since we don't always know the IP of the device we're connecting to, and we may not want to log into the third-party dashboard (Twingate) every time, I developed a script that uses the API to automatically add resources.

This script should run whenever the device connects to the network.

**1. Settings > API > Generate Token**  
**2. Replace the variables in the script accordingly.** 

```python
import json
import os
import socket
import time
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

# Twingate API settings
API_URL = "https://<name>.twingate.com/api/graphql/"
API_KEY = "api-token"
TARGET_NETWORK_NAME = "<network-name>"

# Path for the resources tracking file
RESOURCES_FILE = "/home/pico/scripts/resources.json"

# Function to check internet connectivity
def check_internet_connection(host="8.8.8.8", port=53, timeout=3):
    """
    Check if there is an internet connection by trying to connect to Google's DNS server.
    Returns True if connection is available, False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        socket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout)
        socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM).connect((host, port))
        return True
    except socket.error:
        return False

# Rest of your existing code remains the same

    try:
        automate_resource_creation()
    except Exception as e:

```

**3. Running at Startup**

To run the script at startup, I added the following entry to crontab:

```bash
@reboot /usr/bin/python3 /home/pico/scripts/twingate-updater.py >> /home/pico/scripts/twingate-updater.log 2>&1
```

If necessary, adjust the file and log paths accordingly.

**4. Testing**

To verify that everything is working correctly, I simply restart the device and check if new resources have been created in Twingate. I then log in to the Twingate website to confirm the new resources.

In my case, three new resources were created:

- LAN network IP (connected to the AP): 172.16.0.91
- USB connection IP: 172.32.0.70
- Public IP: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx


**5. Resource Permissions**

With these resources added, I can grant access to either everyone or specific groups. In my case, I assigned the resource to "Everybody."

To verify permissions, I use the Twingate CLI on my host machine:

```bash
twingate resources
```

**6. TCP and UDP Port Permissions**

It is also possible to allow or restrict specific ports for each resource. By default, all ports are open (*).

**7. Testing the Connection**

Once outside the network, I can test the connection by running:

```bash
twingate start
ssh pico@172.16.0.91
```

This establishes a remote connection to the device.

# Testing the Setup

I started by adding SSH access to my Luckfox Pico as a resource. Then, I scanned my network for potential targets:

```bash
nmap -sn -Sv 172.16.0.0/24
```

Once I identified available ports, I manually added specific resources to Twingate. For example, if I found a device at 172.16.0.80 with port 80 open, I could add it as a resource. After that, I could access the device through my browser as if I were inside the network.

# 3D Printed Case

To protect my device and make it more portable, I looked into printing a case. Here are the models I found most useful:

- [Thingiverse Model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6670447)
- [Printables Model](https://www.printables.com/model/945919-luckfox-pico-promax-rv1106-case-pico-plusmini-rv11?lang=en)

# How to Use?
**It's super simple! I just plug the hardware into the Ethernet port, power it with a power bank, a DC adapter, or whatever nearby USB port happens to offer 5V and voil√†!**
