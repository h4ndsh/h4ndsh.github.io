# üèÅ First Steps

Experimenting with the tools that come with the official software is definitely a great start, but I also want to explore adding new modules to the GPIO. To experiment, I installed a community-developed firmware.

## Installing Flipper Zero Firmware Update

First, we need to download the software that communicates with the Flipper Zero via USB. To do this, download from [flipperzero.one](https://flipperzero.one/update). I'm using Linux, the chosen version should be the Linux one. It is also possible to install it on an iPhone or an Android smartphone (via Bluetooth).

![File Download](downloadFileUpdater.png "File Download") 


```bash
mv qFlipper-x86_64-1.3.2.AppImage /usr/bin/flipper
chmod +x /usr/bin/flipper
which flipper
```

To start the program, superuser permission `sudo` may be necessary depending on the circumstances.

```bash
sudo flipper
```
![Interface](interfaceUpdater.png "Interface")


## Installing New Firmware

The provided firmware is sufficient for any type of study, but let's install a firmware developed by the Flipper Zero community that offers many more tools and plugins.

There are several forks of the Flipper Zero firmware. Here are some examples:

| Repository Name | Description |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| [Xtreme-Firmware](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware) | This firmware is a complete overhaul of the Official Firmware, and also features lots of awesome code-bits from Unleashed. |
| [Unleashed-Firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) | Most stable custom firmware focused on new features and improvements of original firmware components, with almost no UI changes. |
| [RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins) | This firmware is a fork of Unleashed and the main Flipper Devices FW! We are NOT paywalled. I will try to keep active development and updates from both in this build along with any other projects that can be found to be useful to the community. I try to keep this FW build the most cutting edge with updates from both and updates from nearly all active community projects. See the RM Games and Plugins for a list of most of those projects. |

To get started, we need to download the firmware. In this case, I will use [unleashed-firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware). I will download version `flipper-z-f7-update-unlshd-063.tgz`.  

![Unleashed Firmeware]( flipper-z-f7-update-unlshd.png "unleashed-firmware")

With the firmware downloaded, simply access the firmware update option, click on `Install from file` and select the file `flipper-z-f7-update-unlshd-063.tgz`, ensuring that the Flipper Zero is already connected to the computer.


# ‚û°Ô∏è Let's Get Started

With everything set up, let's get started!

### NFC

The first attempt I made was to read an NFC card.

NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to exchange data quickly and easily. It works by creating a magnetic field around two devices when they are brought close together, typically within 10 centimeters. This magnetic field can then be used to transmit data between the two devices.

![NFC]( readNFC.png "Read an real NFC card")

NFC is used in a variety of applications, including:

- Mobile payments
- Transit passes
- Access control
- Data sharing

NFC is a versatile and convenient technology that is becoming increasingly common in a variety of applications.
Overall, NFC is a powerful and versatile technology that has a wide range of potential applications.

# üî® Building GPIO modules

The development of GPIO modules for the Flipper Zero is a creative endeavor that involves designing, creating, and implementing novel functionalities. This process encompasses a wide range of activities, from devising innovative attacks to crafting new hardware boards and exploring diverse applications. It encourages ingenuity in utilizing the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) capabilities of the Flipper Zero for both practical and experimental purposes, expanding the device's capabilities and fostering a community-driven approach to innovation.

## ESP32-WROOM

The ESP32-WROOM is a versatile and powerful microcontroller module. A dual-core microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. This tiny yet potent module serves as a playground for hackers, security researchers, and tinkerers seeking to explore the world of hardware hacking and IoT security.

![ESP32-WROOM-32U]( ESP32-WROOM-32U.jpeg "ESP32-WROOM-32U")

- `Marauder Attacks`: WiFi attacks via the ESP32 [Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) involve sending crafted WiFi packets for specific goals. Possible attacks include "Beacon Spam List", "Beacon Spam Random" and "Rick Roll Beacon". These tactics aim to disrupt network discovery and create confusion among nearby devices. Caution is crucial, as unauthorized use of such techniques can be unethical and illegal.

- `Captive Portals`: Hackers can create captive portals with the ESP32 to trick users into connecting to a rogue Wi-Fi network. Once connected, attackers can control the network traffic and potentially launch various exploits.

- `IoT Device Exploitation`: As the IoT ecosystem continues to grow, the ESP32 can be used to audit and assess the security of IoT devices. It can help identify vulnerabilities in smart home devices, industrial systems, and more.

- `Wireless Sniffing and Packet Analysis`: The module's Wi-Fi capabilities make it an excellent tool for monitoring and analyzing wireless networks. It can be used to capture packets, discover network vulnerabilities, and perform Wi-Fi penetration testing.

### Connection with Flipper Zero

Material: 
- 1x PCB Board
- 1x ESP32-WROOM-32U
- 1x Micro SD Card 8GB
- 1x Micro SD TF Module

In addition to these materials, you will also need some basic soldering equipment, such as a soldering iron, solder, and flux.

#### Connect ESP32-WROOM-32U to Flipper Zero
