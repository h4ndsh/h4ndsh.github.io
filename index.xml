    <description><![CDATA[In this post, I share my experience building a DIY stealth remote access device using the Luckfox Pico Max RV1106. Inspired by the commercial LAN Turtle but seeking a more affordable solution, I created this device to enable remote network access without complex port forwarding or traditional VPN setups. This project served as both a practical solution and a valuable learning experience in hardware integration and network security.
