    <description><![CDATA[In this post, I share my experience building a DIY stealth remote access device using the Luckfox Pico Max RV1106. Inspired by the commercial LAN Turtle but seeking a more affordable solution, I created this device to enable remote network access without complex port forwarding or traditional VPN setups. This project served as both a practical solution and a valuable learning experience in hardware integration and network security.

    <description><![CDATA[In this instance, I will delve into an LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability and an RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability. I will utilize the tools within the &lsquo;pearcmd.php&rsquo; file to craft manipulated files. Within a web environment, we can leverage the functionalities of &lsquo;pearcmd&rsquo; by controlling command-line parameters. This Proof of Concept (PoC) is highly specialized, yet it serves as an opportunity for me to explore new methods of penetration within web environments.]]></description>
